# Code of Conduct

As PocketCoder is an early-stage MVP project, a formal Code of Conduct is currently deferred. Our primary focus is on establishing the core functionality and technical documentation.

We aim to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment. If the project grows and attracts a community, we will adopt a comprehensive Code of Conduct, likely based on a widely accepted standard such as the Contributor Covenant.

For now, please refer to basic respectful and constructive behavior in all interactions related to this project.
