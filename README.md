# 🦅 PocketCoder

**PocketCoder** is an experimental, self-hosted AI assistant. It explores the intersection of personal sovereignty and AI agent capabilities, designed to live quietly in your pocket or on your VPS.

## 🧪 The Experiment
PocketCoder is a research project investigating a simple question: *Can we build a powerful, professional-grade coding assistant that is 100% self-hosted and user-controlled?*

To answer this, we are stitching together some of the best open-source technologies into a cohesive system:
- **OpenCode**: For high-level reasoning and agentic loops.
- **PocketBase**: For a lightweight, portable backend and permission system.
- **Tmux**: For resilient, recovering shell sessions.

## 🛡 Core Values
- **Simplicity**: Favoring single binaries and portable architectures over complex microservices.
- **Ownership**: You should own your data, your logs, and your API keys.
- **Privacy**: No telemetry. No hidden usage tracking. Just code.
